# New-Trees-Header-File
We have made a new custom made header file for Trees Data Structure in C++.
 
Custom Libararies are available for BINARY SEARCH TREE, TREES and AVL.

## Binary Search Tree :

To use this header file copy the below given code in your header file 
```
#include"BST.h"
```

Here is a brief description of all the functions available in this header file :

##### Step 1 : Create an Object of BST class and specify the data type in it :

`BST<data_type> obj_name;`

For exmaple,
`BST<char> obj3;` will create a BST in which each data will be of char type and object name is obj3. <br/> 
<br/>
Now you can freely use obj3, i.e, object name to invoke all the functions. Let's have a look at all the functions which are available to us. <br/>
